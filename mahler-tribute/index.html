          <h3>Major points in his life:</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Gustav Mahler was born into a Jewish German-speaking family in Bohemia in 1860. From the outset he was an outsider, a feeling which would remain with him his whole life, wherever he went.</li>
            <li>His father managed an inn, and later opened a brewery. He was prosperous enough to support Gustav's early musical career.</li>
            <li>His family moved to Jihlava where young Gustav heard the music of streets and the gallant march tunes of the town military band.</li>
            <li>He started learning piano at the age of 4, and progressed very quickly. At one stage he was young and enough and skilled enough to earn "child prodigy" status. He gave his first public performance at age 10.</li>
            <li>After doing quite badly at school, his father sent him off to study at the Vienna conservatory. Gustav did well and won some piano prizes. But the young musician started to focus on composing as his main area...</li>
            <li>He left the conservatory at age 18, and began to study literature and philosophy at Vienna University.</li>
            <li>Mahler taught piano and composed a bit after that, took his first conducting job aged 20, and conducted his first full opera at 21.</li>
            <li>He had a string of small conducting jobs after, none of them very pleasant, until he landed a 6 year contract with the prestigious Leipzig Opera, to begin in 1886.</li>
            <li>One of his first jobs was to conduct Wagner's Ring Cycle, but the orchestra didn't like his dictatorial manner and heavy rehearsal schedules very much. Still, he managed to get them to do what he wanted!</li>
            <li>1889 was a tough year for Gustav Mahler. His father died, then a few months later his sister and mother passed away aw well. The year featured the premiere of his first symphony, but it wasn't well-received at all.</li>
            <li>He resigned from Leipzig after 2 years on the job, and got a post as director of the Royal Hungarian Opera in Budapest. After that he took on posts in Hamburg, Leipzig, Vienna, and visited New York frequently towards the end of his life to conduct.</li>
            <li>Despite mounting fame and responsibility as a conductor (he was eventually music director with the New York Philharmonic, and considered one of the world's greatest conductors), composing was his calling. He took to composing in a beautiful cottage by a lake in Austria each summer.</li>
            <li>But the public and critics were confused by his compositions, and generally had negative opinions during Gustav Mahler's lifetime. He was also subjected to anti-Semitism on occasion.
    </li>
            <li>In 1909 he lost his 4 year old daughter to scarlet fever. It was made more poignant by that fact that he had written Kindertotenlieder (Songs on the Death of Children) just a few years earlier.</li>
            <li>Mahler died in May 1911 from a heart condition. He was 50 years old.</li>
